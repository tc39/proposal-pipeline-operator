# Contributing to the ES pipe operator’s proposal
First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

Here are some suggestions to contributing to this proposal.
The pipe operator in JavaScript has a [long and twisty history][HISTORY.md].
A lot of issues have already been argued round in round in circles.

Bearing that in mind, please try to read the following
before making new issues or comments:

1. [HISTORY.md][]: This will give a lot of context
   behind what’s been happening to the proposal since its creation in 2015.
2. The general [TC39 Process][], which summarizes
   how TC39’s “consensus” and “Stages” work.
3. The guide on [contributing to TC39 proposals][contributing guide].
4. The [TC39 Code of Conduct][CoC]:
   It has important information about how we’re all expected to act
   and what to do when we feel like someone’s conduct does not meet the Code.
   We all want to maintain a friendly, productive working environment!
5. The [TC39 How to Give Feedback][feedback] article.
6. The [proposal explainer][] to make sure that it is
   not already addressed there.
7. The [TC39 Matrix guide][] (if you want to chat with TC39 members on Matrix,
   which is a real-time chat platform).

8. If the explainer does not already explain your topic adequately,
   then please [search the GitHub repository’s issues][issues]
   to see if any issues match the topic you had in mind.
   This proposal is more than four years old,
   and it is likely that the topic has already been raised and thoroughly discussed.

You can leave a comment on an [existing GitHub issue][issues],
create a new issue (but really do try to [find an existing GitHub issue][issues] first),
or [participate on Matrix][TC39 Matrix guide].

Please try to keep any existing GitHub issues on their original topic.

If you feel that someone’s conduct is not meeting the [TC39 Code of Conduct][CoC],
whether in this GitHub repository or in a [TC39 Matrix room][TC39 Matrix guide],
then please follow the [Code of Conduct][CoC]’s directions for reporting the violation,
including emailing [tc39-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com][].

Thank you again for taking the time to contribute!
